Week 3 Challenge - Password Generator

Made a page that has a flexbox with the options to make a secure password.

For the criterias to generate the password, first criteria asks how long the user wants the password to be; hinting it should be more than 7 words and less than 129 words.

Then the criteria asks if the user wants to include any uppercase characters, lowercase characters, any numbers and/or any special characters. 

If the questions about uppercase, lowercase, numbers & special characters are all unchecked, a message pops up saying select at least one and password is not generated.

Once the above criterias are fulfilled, a unique secure password is generated and shown on the page.
